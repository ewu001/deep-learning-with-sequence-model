0,Disappointed.  Purchased March 27 and stopped working June 10th(my birthday of all days).  I was really enjoying this coffee maker until stopped working.  The water component doesn't appear to be working get a few drops in the cup then it quits.  Tried turning it off and on and took the water sleeve off and put it back on nothing worked.  My sister has had hers for years w no issues.,Complaint

5,"Didn't live up to all the hype, only had this Keurig for a month as it was a Christmas gift and it stopped working. When it worked it was great but given the amount of money for these Keurigs i expected better. Very disappointed ?? my Mr Coffee maker lasted 2yrs.",Complaint

15,"More proof that R&D departments waste consumers' money. Since these people have to justify their jobs, they've never heard of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" The smaller water reservoir is a pain in the butt, particularly since the need water light doesn't appear until AFTER you try to make a cup of coffee. Just what I need when I get out of bed -- more hassle. Of course, anti-development will continue. Wonder what they'll screw up next.",Complaint
16,"4 stars because the box came open and broken.  Other than that, the product inside is fine.",Complaint
17,"I keep buying this for the convenience but those who say it soon stops dispensing water in expected amounts are correct. An area impossible to get to gets clogged and there is no practical way to clear it. I guess it keeps us buying the product. Therefore, every few months I buy another.",Complaint
18,"We were skeptical when we purchased the Keuring, but I would trade it for anything. Easy and quick to use. We love trying the different flavors of coffee, tea, and hot chocolate",Praise

21,bought to replace my old one.  I love Keurigs!,Praise
22,"I received the K55 as a Birthday present in September. Works fine and delivers a good cup of coffee, every time. There are three drawbacks to the design and this may not bother, others but worth noting. 1) The brew sizes are limited to 6oz, 8oz, and 10oz. A 12oz brew would be preferable as I have to use the 6oz brewing cycle, twice with one KCup to achieve the 12oz cup I normally drink. 2) The 48oz water container may be fine for some, but I fill it much more often than I would like and the machine consistently indicates ""add more water"" and will not brew when there is approximately 8oz of water remaining in the reservoir. 3) Many travel mugs, do not fit under the brew head, even when the bottom tray is removed.  Still a well-made product and does what it is supposed to do. Just wish the developers had put a bit more thought into the functional design.",Ambivalent
23,"This is my second Keurig. The first one lasted for ELEVEN YEARS! With proper maintenance, these machines can really last. This particular model is perfect, it was priced right.",Praise
24,i love my k55 so much! hope everybody enjoys it this much. buying a second one for my brother right now!!!,Praise
25,"Pretty good! I use it at work and once I found the right coffee, I love it.  I like it because it because the coffee will always be fresh as opposed to sitting in the carafe for an hour or two. Auto shut off is a plus.",Praise
26,Great machine. If you like coffee you'll love this Keurig,Praise
27,I had a Keurig for years and was very pleased with it.  It started leaking so it was time for a new one.  This is the second Keurig K55 that I have received.  The first did not work right and I had to return.  This I am having the same problem.  You pre the button to start the brew and a small amount of water comes out and stops.  I turn off the machine and back on and it works.  Not sure how long this will last but tired of having to return!Not sure what the problem is here.  Either they are not being made good anymore or someone is selling returned merchandise.,Ambivalent

34,"Simple to use, but my only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't indicate water is needed until after a brew button has been pushed, so if I push the button and walk away I might come back to see the blue refill light on and no coffee in my cup. It should indicate water is needed before I push the button, and not flash the brew buttons unless there is enough water for the largest cup option.",Ambivalent
35,"Don't know what else to say, it works great",Satisfied

41,I'm in love with my Keurig! I really enjoy this model over the original basic model. The filtered water is nice. You don't have to refill every single time you want a cup of joe. It has an alert light when you need to clean it. So you don't have to worry about mold and such. It's also nice to be able to pick the size of your cup. You choose whether you want a standard mug or enough to fill your thermos.  I have been very happy with my Keurig.,Praise

51,I LOVE my new Keurig!  Price was perfect!,Praise
52,The machine barely works. There is some type of glitch with the filter and water auction point that just keeps the machine running and never fills a cup.,Complaint

55,It does not auto turn off like the previous model! Annoying.,Complaint
56,"Overall, really like this machine. Easy to use & fast. I wish the water tank was a touch bigger b/c the sensor goes off (wanting to be refilled) long before it is really that low. Coffee comes out great & the best part is no clean up. :)",Satisfied

65,"5 months and won't brew coffee.  brewed on largest setting and it took 3 cycles to get 1 single cup.changed filter, water tank is full and have only used filtered water into the tank.don't buy this junk",Complaint
66,"Worked great for 2 months and then all of the sudden, it stopped working. I am sending it back",Complaint
67,"I took off a star because it does not come with the cup size I like. Apparently, you have to look for appropriate cup sizes before you purchase any particular model of the Keurig coffee maker. I'm used to 10-1/4 oz cupsâthat's what my old Keurig made at max size, and the size of my favorite mugs. The max cup size on this model is 9-1/4 oz. The other two sizes (there's only 3) are 7-1/4 oz and 5-1/4 oz. I have to run the 5-1/4 oz twice to fill my mug.I suppose that is my fault since I just assumed the cup sizes in all Keurigs were the same.Still makes a damn good cup of coffee, though.",Complaint
68,"This product is convenient.  Although I haven't found a brand of coffee I really like, it seems that everyone else has.Consider this - you will have to take a day off from work to descale it (recommended that this be done every three months.and it takes hours.)The Keurig descaling solution is around $11.00 on Amazon, and I really think you can make your own solution with vinegarand water.",Complaint
69,"Outstanding coffee maker. The last one I had lasted at least five years. Just don't drop it on the floor, it doesn't work well after that.",Praise
70,does not make coffee hot. Always have to microwave it after brewing coffee.,Complaint
71,"Love the Keurig coffee maker but I think we just got a bad one.  This was our second that we bought Nov 9 last year and it quit working today (May 27). We neglected to send in the warranty card or we could have likely gotten a replacement.  We did maintain it properly but it made more noise than the other one (that lasted much,  much longer) from the beginning.",Praise
72,"I have a older version of this and I wanted to upgrade , no reason just been around 3-4 years so why not.  Get it the handle is cheap plastic feel,  drip tray is plactic,  and the water doesn't have a glow light.  Mean while my older model has all ""metal"" and a water glow light not a fan",Complaint
73,On a camping trip ( in an RV) this is a brand new keurig and it glitches...doesnt brew a cup then it does...dont mention descaling...this is NEW....dang and when on a trip u NEED it to work. ugh,Complaint

75,"Love this coffee maker!  Same cup of coffee every time.  One star deduct for the 9oz max size.  Wish this unit had 11-12 oz capacity, but that being the only complaint, recommend this to everyone.",Praise
76,It has 3 cups sizes and is quieter than my old one.,Ambivalent
77,"We were very disappointed. It worked with the first cup, but then after, it only worked when it wanted. I called Keurig and they told me to watch a video. I then went into Amazon to see if I could return it. Iwas told it was over 30 days so I could not. Actually I had purchased after Christmas, but had wanted to finish the ground coffee I had before using my Keurig so problems started as soon as we used it. I didn't realize I had only 30 days to return it or I would have used it right away, and not waited to finish my ground coffee.",Complaint
78,"I love these coffee makers. My husband and I only drink 1 or 2 cups in the mornings & at different times, so it's perfect to only brew 1 cup at a time.  I gave my old one to my son, who just moved into his first apartment.",Praise
79,I love this Keurig; have one and purchased this for a gift.,Praise
80,Very happy with our purchase. It's our first Keurig machine ever.  It's just what we need in our house.  We all like coffee but different types etc.  Makes a large cup in minutes.  I have no complaints.,Praise
81,What a stinker! Failed to heat water after 3 months. Of course it's past the return time for Amazon to help. So now I'm contacting Keurig to see if they will listen to my complaint. Even run water through 3 different water filters and still failed. Not sure 1 star is a fair rating.,Complaint
82,Great machine !!,Satisfied
83,"I bought this product on Nov 28th, 2016 (from Amazon.com LLC). The Amazon return window closed on Jan 31, 2017. Guess what... The water stopped filtering through and this Keurig conveniently stopped working on Feb 6, 2017. I even tried running the machine with water several times without a k-cup to no avail. It luckily does carry a 1-year manufacturer's warranty, and I was on the phone nearly an hour with the Keurig Support. The only reason I did not give this a 1 star rating is because Keuring did agree to honor their warranty and send a replacement for their machine. Now it's a wait for 7 more days and a hope that the replacement does work. Although they did replace it, the waste of time and harassment of having to call the coffee maker support within the first 90 days after buying it just isn't worth it.",Complaint
84,To replace a B70 so the comparison is a bit unfair but a better alternative to the 2.0 version since I have a full inventory of the original k-cups.,Ambivalent
85,"Super slow coffee maker. The earlier models seem to be better! Love Keurig, but this doesnt seem to be the best model.",Complaint
86,I was pretty skeptical about buying a Keurig because I don't really drink coffee often. To my surprise there are tea pods! I use my keurig at least once a day and I can't find anything bad to say about it.,Satisfied
87,"OMG why didn't we get one of these long ago!  No more wasted pots of coffee.  And I can make tea on the spot.  Got the refillable Brewslang K cups, very cool.  I can adjust the strength of coffee for each person's taste, or make tea with loose tea.  Bought a second one for my 91 yr old dad's house, he loves it too.  So easy to set up, even for this non-DIY blonde!  (And since I AM blonde, I can make blonde jokes, so there!)  Mummy will be getting one for Mum's day, fer sure!",Praise

95,What a really nice quality kitchen appliance.  I love my coffee in the morning and different teas during the day.  One of the best things I've found about my new machine is that there is no MESS to deal with.  I highly recommend it to everyone!,Praise
96,My first Keurig was a gift from my daughter. I really liked having a good fast cup of coffee that was brewed from my own coffee blend.  It only lasted about a year and quit working.  I thought I'd buy another one but a number of people I talked to advised against the Kurig brand because they don't last very long.  I should have listened.  I bought the Model K55 and it quit in about a year.  That's $200 worth of coffee makers in about 2 years.  That doesn't make sense.  I'll never buy another one and I'd advise anyone not to buy one unless they plan on replacing it often and spending about $100 per year for their coffee maker.,Complaint
97,"We got this as a replacement for an older model and have been a bit disappointed.  One improvement is the intake filtering has been upgraded to a removeable one.  That was what clogged for good on our older model.  This new unit is very basic ... smaller water reservoir with no hinged lid (you have to just remove the top to add water and replace ... no temperature adjustment, although we find the one temp to be OK ... there are 3 volume adjustments, but all are less than the older model ... the largest is only 10oz. ... I guess for a travel mug you could run it through twice.  Anyway, this is the ""basic"" model, and to me a bit over-priced for the features you get.  Another $20 and you could get the fancy one.  All that said, we still love the Keurig process, and would have a hard time going back to the old Mr. Coffee.",Complaint
98,Works great,Satisfied
99,Great price!  I use it everyday!,Praise
