6,"Very disappointed with this product. It has not worked correctly and consistently. Called the support team and they told me to clean the machine. I had it less than 1 month using filtered water and it requires cleaning? I cleaned it as they said, next day it is not working again. Some days it will work and some days it wont. I had to go back to my old drip coffee maker to have my morning cup. I do not recommend this product. Ether try a different model or a different product but pass on the K55.",Complaint
7,"it is small enough to go in a corner. makes coffee fast, easy to use.  wish I had bought it sooner.  great for one or 2 people, no waist of coffee at all. use my own coffee in the reusable mesh cups. have already saved money.",Satisfied
8,"My order came on time. Where I am located I was not able to use this item. Two days ago I finally got to open the box and the coffee machine does not work. I went to my orders and then noticed that I missed the window to return...this is not good for me at all. Situation is I'm in Iraq working and because of my mission I was able to open this box not even realizing that I could have return it. Further more I cannot request a return receipt from the seller....I have SO many K-cups, I mean boxes with 64 boxes in each box. My mates and I were looking for this to work.BTW, my dash board reads that an item/s (not this one in questions) is still delivered but in fact I have already received it.",Complaint

11,"Used less than 10 times and it's not working! Great, more junk for my money! Oh, it's past the 30 day return window. Can't return the JUNK!",Complaint
12,"Love this keurig. Can use any kcups. I had a k475. It was nice but you had to use specific keurig k cups that the machine ""read"". If they were not the right cups....No coffee.",Ambivalent
13,Just what I needed now that I am alone.,Satisfied
14,kids and family love it. gets them to drink tea instead of soda and juices.,Satisfied
15,The Keurig is awesome!  We love it!,Praise
16,I'm a little disappointed.  I had one of the original Keurigs and it definitely made a better cup of coffee.  This one tastes somewhat watered down so I've found I have to purchase the dark and bold cups to get close to what I like in a cup of coffee.  I expected better.,Complaint
17,"It stopped working 3 weeks after we bought it and my husband spent considerable time on the phone with Keurig cleaning pins, etc. to make it work again.  Very helpful customer service, but the applicance shouldn't break down after 3 weeks.",Ambivalent
18,"Just what I wanted, a no frills one shot Keurig with a reservoir - which spoiled me and now I'd like an even larger reservoir I drink so much coffee.",Satisfied
19,Works great. Makes alot of noise and does not hold alot of water,Ambivalent
20,"This is actual 4th purchase of a Keurig - one as a gift, one for work, and two for home (over the last 16 yrs).  I love the using this on workday mornings when I barely have time for one cup.  Wish they would make the environmentally better k-cups - like those used by San Francisco Bay.",Satisfied
21,Bought this for my 87-year-old mother who has mobility issues.  She wasn't able to make her coffee anymore in her large pot as she could no longer lift the full carafe of water to put in the machine.  Now she can just make a cup at a time and feel independent.  It is so hard to get old and things we took for granted before are no longer available to us.  This totally solved her problem.  The machine is simple enough for her to use and makes a delicious cup of coffee.,Satisfied
22,My husband is in LOVE with his Father's day gift! It arrived on time and in great shape. This is definitely the gift that keeps on giving!,Praise
23,"We are happy with our purchase, it met all our expectations.",Satisfied

29,It is everything and more than its descriptionâ€¼,Praise
30,"Replaced our first Keurig after several years of use - got tired of standing on my head sticking paper clips into the spout holes.Thus far, the replacement model is easier to use.  Auto turn off after 2 hours, so no frustration with clock setting.  Buttons are clear & easy to use.The only downside is that the water container is much smaller.  With just two of us using it, we have to fill the tank every day.  A minor inconvenience, but still....It remains to be seen how long we can go before things start clogging up.",Ambivalent
31,At first the convenience was a welcomed change but now I think making a pot of coffee in the morning and having it throughout my day might be preferable.  Plus the expense is even more than I anticipated...I use about 5 cups per day between drinking coffee in the morning and tea or hot chocolate in the evening.,Ambivalent
32,Purchased this for another person--so far so good!!,Satisfied
33,This has a great size water tank---works in a minute,Satisfied
34,gave for a gift,Ambivalent
35,"defected product, hope 2nd purchase is worth it..",Complaint
36,Love my Keurig! Was hesitant for so long but I am happy with my purchase. The ONLY thing I find odd is that when making a small cup it is sort of watery compared to the larger cups.,Ambivalent
37,Love it... but Have had to replace this twice....planned obsalecence,Ambivalent
38,The machine broke in just a few months. This is not worth the money.,Complaint
39,Gave as a gift.,Ambivalent
40,Love!!!,Praise
41,"I've waited YEARS to get a Keurig & I finally bought myself one for Christmas. Wouldn't ya know, it stopped working in less than a month! And of course the return window is closed already. Awesome!  Guess it's back to the ol' coffee pot! BOOO!",Complaint
42,It's okay love the pot maybe just enjoy the model,Satisfied
43,AWEsome product and service!,Praise
44,"Do NOT buy this coffee maker!Mine was fine, then suddenly it stopped working one morning about 1 month after I purchased it.  Now it just makes a lot of gurgling noises, but no coffee.  I tried all the obvious things but I do not plan to take this thing apart.I pulled out my old Mr. Coffee that is still good after all these years.",Complaint
45,So glad I purchased this it is fantastic.,Praise
46,"Faulty from day 1 and didn't last 3 days!  This was my second Keurig.  The first one lasted only a year or so.  I was nervous about getting a second one, since the first one was pretty short lived.  Now I'm sorry I spent my gift card money on it.",Complaint
47,"My first keurig ever, and I'm inlove. I've had it since March & I use it for coffee, tea, hot chocolate, ect. When cleaning it does take a while (I used 1 part water and 1 part white vinegar). But it cleaned very well. I use my own reusable k cup for coffee because k cups get expensive, and I brew regular hot water into a coffee mug and use tea bags for my tea. Holds enough water for 4-5 regular sized cups. Everyone is updating to the new 2.0 but I will use this one until it craps the bed.",Satisfied
48,Great coffee maker I bought this to replace an order model I took to work to use there. I love Keuig it's so simple and easy when you don't drink a lot of coffee and only want one cup.,Praise
49,Great brew machine. Worth every penny.,Praise
50,The bottom where the water supply connects broke and we super glued it... not sure why that wouldn't be a stronger material or design for that connection.,Complaint
51,Works great!,Satisfied
52,"First time owning a Keurig and I love this model. I do need to refill the water somewhat frequently (every 5-6 cups brewed) but the reservoir is removable and easy to refill. This is a perfect for a small kitchen, does not take up a lot of counter space.",Satisfied
53,"Bought this to replace my old Mr Coffee brewer, and I really like this model.  Being able to choose size/strength is wonderful!",Satisfied
54,I love it! So easy and can't imagine life without my Keurig now.,Praise
55,"very nice , had a small one  but like this better  don't have to fill water as often and makes bigger cups of coffee",Praise
56,We're enjoying it everyday.,Praise
57,"I received this coffee maker, ran the first mug of water through to clean it out and then the whole system shut off and won't turn back on again.I called Keurig and they don't have a solution, this product is supposed to be new and it won't even turn on. Luckily, Keurig are offering me a replacement.",Ambivalent
58,Great product that delivers as advertised.,Satisfied
59,"Convenient, coffee good.",Satisfied
60,Unit performed as predicted still haven't mastered pods for strength as I don't enjoy strong coffee,Ambivalent
61,"This is the first time we bought one of these Keurigs for ourselves.  We are very happy with it.  It works great!  We are now wondering, what took us so long to purchase a Keurig?",Praise
62,"Ultimate sin to have a single cup of coffee. Could be argued that this can save money as you don't throw ""old"" coffee away. Be sure to use the auto off feature as we left the old Keurig on all the time. 24 hours of constant heating may have lead to it's demise after 3 years of faithful service.",Ambivalent
63,"unit only works occasionally. I bought the 3 year warrantee, and now can't use it, can't fix it, can't return it.I could not be more unhappy. This was our third and LAST Keurig item!!.",Complaint
64,Great price...Great coffee,Praise
65,Very nice unit at a great price,Praise
66,"Just amazing! I love my Keurig can't live without it, matter of fact I am gifting one to my buddy for his birthday!",Praise
67,Coffee pot received on time and works great. I am so happy to make my coffee again. Gina C,Satisfied
68,Fair price & prompt delivery made this my choice over shopping local. I got exactly what I wanted.,Satisfied
69,"I'm recently widowed and only drink one cup of coffee in the morning, so I really enjoy that I can have my morning coffee so easy & quick. Works perfectly. I also got in on a good sale, which made buying this Keurig that much more attractive.",Praise
70,"I'm not sure if I was shipped the wrong item, or if this is false advertising, but this is most certainly not ""programmable"".  There's an auto off button that you can push so that it turns off 2 hours after brewing, but that's all. I was expecting a way to set it up so that when I go down in the morning it's already warmed up and ready to bre (like my old model). But it ain't so :(. Longest minute of my life waiting for the warmup!",Complaint
71,"So far, so good!",Satisfied
72,I got this for the people at work. They seem to love it.,Satisfied

75,"I've had this for over a month now, and so far it is working perfectly. I was a little concerned with some of the bad reviews I've seen. But no complaints yet.",Satisfied
76,"Keurig coffee machines typically don't last more than a couple of years, I accepted that when I made this purchase. However, this item lasted less than 24 hours of use before failing. Returned item and purchasing a maker from a different brand.",Complaint
77,Ho ya we love this bad boy.,Praise
78,"Best coffee machine for a lazy guy like me! Works well, makes coffee quickly, no problems at all. Totally in love with this machine!It takes about 30 seconds after you click to heat the water, and another 30 seconds to fill up the largest cup (it has 3 cup sizes). No hassle at all.",Praise
79,Very happy with my Keurig!!,Praise
80,Easy to use. My step father loves it!,Praise
81,"the machine works and everything, but my coffee always comes out watery, i gave it some time and tried differently k cups but they all always come out watery, regret buying this.",Complaint
82,"Excellent product. This is our 2nd one and we love it. Fast and easy. Can switch between coffee and tea without worries about cross-flow. Read some complaints about it not being hot enough. It is perfect for me. Yes, my wife likes it a bit hotter, so 20 seconds in the microwave and we are ready to go.",Satisfied
83,As expected,Satisfied
84,Coffee just doesn't taste as good as in the old Keurig.,Complaint
85,Stopped working today for no apparent reason.  This is at a vacation home so it doesn't get used all that much.  Will have re-order and try one time.,Complaint
86,Very good,Praise
87,Keurigs suck,Complaint
88,Great product. Enjoying my coffee everyday now.,Satisfied
89,"This thing is garbage. I bought one for my office and I can't get it to work properly. I read the owners manual all the way through and I'm doing exactly as it instructs (it shouldn't require any level of intelligence to operate). It only fills my coffee cup up an inch on every cup size setting, even if the water in the tank if filled up to the brim. I didn't open it for several weeks after I purchased it and now I've missed my return window per Amazon's policy. I have a different Keurig model at home that is much better made. I may just have the 1 in a million defect model, but I'd advise going with a different model if you're on the market.",Complaint

91,We have not used it yet but I love my other one,Ambivalent

99,"Haven't used it yet. but, I have one at work and I love it. The reason I bought this one. Will start using it, when I use up all of my un-ground coffee beans I have in house as of now.",Ambivalent
100,"Avoid buying this product.  Received January 10th.  Stopped working January 19th.  Called Keurig and they seemed to be aware of this issue and would send a repair part.  4 weeks later no repair part.  Called Keurig and they said the part was on back order and we'll receive it sometime in the latter part of March.  Horrible product and service.  I've purchased Keurigs now for the last 10 years...seems like I'm replacing them every year or so, but this takes the cake....broke in just over a week and 2 bad service experiences.",Complaint
